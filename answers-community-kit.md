Request for Hack: Answers Community Kit
========

Code for America application [Honolulu Answers](http://answers.honolulu.gov/), redeployed as [Oakland Answers](http://answers.oaklandnet.com/), requires a critical “write-a-thon” community event to succeed:

ReWrite Oakland will be an all day writeathon that will culminate with the launch of a new website called “Oakland Answers,” based on last year’s Code for America project “Honolulu Answers.” Oakland Answers will be citizen-focused website, written in plain-language, that makes it quick and simple for people to find City information and services they are looking for online. City staff and the community will collaborate to answer common questions generated by citizens. —[Hacking the Change You Want to See, 2013](http://codeforamerica.org/2013/05/21/hacking-the-change-you-want-to-see/).

To ease the deployment of new Answers sites, we are looking for **the creation of an Answers Write-a-Thon Community Kit**.


The Product
--------

The write-a-thon community kit should be a web-based, step-by-step guide to running a write-a-thon. It needn’t cover the installation of an Answers application (that’s for a separate hack request), but should guide hopeful write-a-thon leaders in venue selection, question choice, and answer writing. We’re looking for a series of checklists and a simple set of instructions that can be repeated in any city or neighnorhood, large or small.


Help Available
