Request for Hack: Broken Windows
========
This is a description for a potential civic app.

## The Opportunity 
Analyze whether code enforcement -- building, restaurant, etc -- have any correlation to crime.

## The Impact
James Q Wilson famously argued that visible issues around building quality -- eg broken windows -- could lead to increased crime. This theory led to a new wave of more proactive community policing. With the advent of open data standards such as LIVES and HouseFacts, along with an increasing amount of publicly available crime data, data scientists can now more openly explore and test this hypothesis.

## The Use Case
Users can visualize and compare aggregate code and crime -- and any other relevant data -- historically for a community; ideally, you could offset the crime data, for instance, to explore correlations.

## The Difficulty
* Accessing good crime data
* Having sufficient data to draw conclusions
* Determining the correct kind of visualization and aggregation

## The Data
* LIVES: foodinspectiondata.us
* HouseFact: housefacts.me
* Crime (varies)
