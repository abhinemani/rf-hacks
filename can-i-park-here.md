Request for Hack: Can I Park Here?
========

2) Parking strikes me as one of those things we should try to do something about. Have you guys seen anything really compelling? I realize GPS isn't precise enough (or has that changed?), but if we could find some kind of unique ID for a space, and then brought together all the data (street closures, alternative side, hours, and availability) into a simple SMS based app -- "Can I park here?" -- I feel like it would resonate. Location, though, will likely be a dealbreaker.
