Request for Hack: Can I Park Here?
========
This is a description for a potential civic app.

## The Opportunity 
Create a simple SMS-based tool to let citizens know whether they can park in a given location. 

## Why would this matter
The vast number of 311 calls into most cities' call centers are information -- citizens asking questions -- and of those, parking questions are often a plurality. In New York City, they receive over 35,000 calls a day about "alternative side parking" alone. Since multiple rules and datasets govern parking, it is difficult for citizens to know what the rules really are. By pulling together those rules into a simple interface, you could not only reduce the burden on city call centers, but save citizens time, money, and frustration.

## Core Use Case
User texts in location -- either parking space number or address -- and receives back a simple "yes," "no," or "not sure," following by more explanatory information, based on the available data.

## Why this is hard
Identifying the location of the parking spot will be difficult. Parking spaces often are not numbered, and do not map directly to addresses or parcel data -- even though rules and restrictions sometimes are detailed down to an individual spot. Additionally, GPS is sometimes not precise enough to identify the particular location of the unit.

## Data Suggestions
* City Parking Spaces
* Street Closures
* Street Cleanings
* Parking times & rules
