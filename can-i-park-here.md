Request for Hack: Can I Park Here?
========
This is a description for a potential civic app.

## The Opportunity 
Create a simple SMS-based tool to let citizens know whether they can park in a given location. 

## The Impact
New York City's 311  center receive over 35,000 calls a day about "alternative side parking" alone; other cities, while at a different scale, face a common problem. Since multiple rules and datasets govern parking, it is difficult for citizens to know what the rules really are. By pulling together those rules into a simple interface, you could not only reduce the burden on city call centers, but save citizens time, money, and frustration.

## The Use Case
User texts in location -- either parking space number or address -- and receives back a simple "yes," "no," or "not sure," following by more explanatory information, based on the available data.

## The Difficulty
Identifying the location of the parking spot will be difficult. Parking spaces often are not numbered, and do not map directly to addresses or parcel data -- even though rules and restrictions sometimes are detailed down to an individual spot. Additionally, GPS is sometimes not precise enough to identify the particular location of the unit.

## The Data
* City Parking Spaces
* Street Closures
* Street Cleanings
* Parking times & rules
* What else?
