Request for Hack: Data.CodeforAmerica.org
========
This is a description for a potential civic app.

Based on data from [mapped open data catalogs](data-catalog-mapping.md), [census area API](census-area-API.md), and [scraped open data catalogs](data-catalog-scraping.md), create a unified open data index site with a mapped view of the country showing hot spots where good open data exists.

## The Opportunity 
A one-stop shop for civic developers looking to access standardized data from the dozens of cities CfA engages.

## The Impact
City after city is standing up an open data catalog, and while standardization efforts are emerging to make the data interoperable, that data still isn't easily accessible. By pulling together data from various cities into one, easy-to-use resources, you could dramatically reduce the barrier to entry for civic hackers and profoundly increase the opportunity for scale and reuse.

## The Use Case
Much like using YQL, a developer could query and dataset type and a location and receive a programmatically accessible feed for that data set.

## The Difficulty
* Technology infrastructure to support massive users
* Data management issue of hosting/ownership (does CfA scrape the data, link it, etc)
* Prioritization

## The Data
All the data.
