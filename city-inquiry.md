Request for Hack: 311 Inquiry & City Answers
========

It'd be interesting to push HNL Answers more as a 311-type of solution, maybe as a new stab at the inquiry API. The thought occurred to me during the conference. Let me see with the brigade if there's any group thinking about deploying the app, where we might be able to use the 311 call center data (in addition to web traffic) to inform what answers go on the site. Plus, for cities w/ 311 websites/services, it would be interesting to see if they might be willing to link to the answers site.
