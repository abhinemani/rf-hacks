Request for Hack: Map Open Data Catalogs
====

Map open data catalogs (e.g. Socrata instances) to jurisdictions and boundaries, supplying each with a US Census ID and Open Civic Data ID so we can tell what actual area they cover.

Starting points for data catalogs:

* http://ckan.org/instances/
* https://opendata.socrata.com/browse?tags=socrata+customers
