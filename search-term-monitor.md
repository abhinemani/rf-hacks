Hack Request: Search Term Monitor
====

A trimmed-down Google Analytics that shows only two things: a leaderboard of historical search terms (since launch) for a website where a bug is deployed, and a streaming list of current search terms. GDS uses a [similar display for gov.uk](http://www.flickr.com/photos/benterrett/8701030005/). Should be deployable to Heroku or via an AMI or similar, and will be useful for our 2014 cities if we ask them to deploy to their websites in the months prior to project start in January.
